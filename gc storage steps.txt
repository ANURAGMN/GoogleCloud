OR FOR PICKLE FILE :

	fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()
	with fs.open(model_path, 'rb') as model_file:
    		loaded_model = pickle.load(model_file)

	model_path = 'gs://BUCKET-NAME/FILE-NAME'

	with fs.open(model_path, 'wb') as model_file:
    		pickle.dump(gridrfr, model_file)

OR TO ACCESS FILE DIRECT FROM CLOUD STORAGE WITHOUT DOWNLOADING :


	fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()
	with fs.open(gcs_path) as f:
    		data = pd.read_csv(f)
